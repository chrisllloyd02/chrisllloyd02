- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisllloyd02 aka Chris Lloyd
- 👀 I’m interested in ... app development to assist people with their lives - and to assist people to become innovative, contributory members of a forward-looking society
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... well, I'm still learning what I need to know in order to develop the projects I have in my head. Any ideas? I have horribly limited programming experience  - almost none, but not quite.  Many years ago (at the start of the PC generation) I did an evening course where I mostly learned how important it was to be able to touch type... But we did write some code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I'm looking to collaborate on mind-improving apps and generation of personal fact accumulation/fake-news avoidence information maps (sort of like a mind map, but more)
- 📫 How to reach me ... chrisllloyd02@gmail.com
